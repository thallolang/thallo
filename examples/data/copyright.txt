cone.ply - Created by Michael Zollhoefer and released into the public domain
dogdance0.png - A single frame from the DogDance sequence in the 
    http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/data/ dataset.
dogdance1.png - The frame following dogdance1.png in the sequence.
head.ply - This file contains data from a 3D model that commonly appears in
    scientific publications, and has entered the public domain through this
    unrestricted use and may be freely distributed. Originally distributed by
    Brown University, this was redistributed in the G3D Innovation Engine
    (http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/), and converted to .ply format (from .ifs) by
    Michael Mara (mmara@cs.stanford.edu).

poisson_mask.png - Mask file for the merger of poisson0.png and poisson1.png
    created by Michael Mara. This mask file is released into the 
    public domain.
raptor_simplify2k.mrk - Marker file for raptor_simplify2k.off, created by 
    Michael Mara. This marker file is released into the public domain.
raptor_simplify2k.off - The original raptor.off (not included here) was 
    downloaded from 
    (http://visionair.ge.imati.cnr.it/ontologies/shapes/view.jsp?id=178-Raptor)
    and is governed by the AIM@SHAPE-VISIONAIR General License for Shapes, 
    reproduced in full below. The raptor_simplify2k.off model was generated by
    mesh simplification using MeshLab to reduce the model complexity while 
    retaining the general shape.
shaped_from_shading/* - These files were generated intially from a scan taken
    by Michael Zollhöfer using a depth camera on an antique collection in 
    Erlangen, and then converted into an ad-hoc binary format for transfer
    between different shape-from-shading programs. They are released into the
    public domain.
small_armadillo.ply - A substantially simplified version of the armadillo scan
    from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository 
    (https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/). 
    "You are welcome to use the data and models for research purposes. You are
    also welcome to mirror or redistribute them for free. Finally, you may
    publish images made using these models, or the images on this web site, in
    a scholarly article or book - as long as credit is given to the Stanford
    Computer Graphics Laboratory. However, such models or images are not to be
    used for commercial purposes, nor should they appear in a product for sale
    (with the exception of scholarly journals or books), without our 
    permission."
small_armadillo.mrk - Handcrafted marker points for small_armadillo.ply,
    created by Michael Mara. This marker file is released into the public
    domain.
sphere.ply - Created by Michael Zollhoefer and released into the public domain
squat_source.obj - From the "squat 2" dataset from
    http://people.csail.mit.edu/drdaniel/mesh_animation/index.html related to 
    the publication: Articulated Mesh Animation from Multi-view Silhouettes 
    ACM Transactions on Graphics 27(3), 2008

AIM@SHAPE-VISIONAIR General License for Shapes

Applicable terms
----------------

This is the general AIM@SHAPE & VISIONAIR license applicable to models 
in the Shape Repository. It should be noted that each model is a
representation of, and is distinct from, a shape, whether physical or
imaginary. While the shape may be subject to its own terms, the terms
governing the model you are about to download are described herein.

For some models, the owners have defined specific licenses. The terms
and conditions laid down in these licenses are in addition to the
terms prescribed here, and are to be adhered to strictly when using
such models.

Acknowledgements
----------------

When including models from the Shape Repository in your website or
research work, or when using them for other purposes allowed by the
terms described herein, the AIM@SHAPE and VISIONAIR projects and the model
owner must be acknowledged as the sources of the models, for example with
the phrase, "... model is provided courtesy of <model_owner> by the
AIM@SHAPE-VISIONAIR Shape Repository."

Information on <model_owner> is present in the accompanying metadata
files and, where present, owner licenses.

Metadata
--------

Each model is accompanied by its metadata file. Please keep this file
with the model as it contains important information about the
model. Please let us know if you find any errors in the metadata.

(Im)proper use
--------------

Some models in the Shape Repository represent artifacts of religious,
cultural and/or historical significance, e.g. the Max Planck
model. Such models have been entrusted to the Shape Repository under
the hope that they will be used respectfully and
conscientiously. Please refrain from conducting experiments on them
that may be rash or insensitive to people's feelings. Such experiments
include, but are not limited to, morphing, animation, boolean
operations, simulations of burning, breaking, exploding and melting.

Models in the Shape Repository are made freely available for research
and non-commercial purposes only. Use of these models for commercial
purposes is permitted only after the express approval of the Shape
Repository and the onwner has been obtained. Please contact us using
the webform on our site in this regard.
